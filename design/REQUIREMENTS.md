# Requirements

Initially perform simulation in frontend.
Design with possibility of simulation taking place in backend taken into account.

Initially do not support persistence.
Design with future support for persistence taken into account.

Initially only support one simulation.
Design with future support for multiple simulations in the same browser tab taken into account.
